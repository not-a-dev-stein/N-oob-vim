# N(oob)vim
A set of configurations for Neovim made in Lua by someone who doesn't know Lua but has a lot of free time.

## My objective
I like Neovim. A lot. I tried using VsCode for my really basic programming needs, but I was both a bit overwhelming and kind of dissappointing, specially when it comes to resource usage. So I went back to Neovim, and found out that almost none of the pre-configured configs out there really felt like home, and decided to create my own.

With no experience in Lua, a lot of procrastination time that should have gone to college work poured into it and a lot of trial and error, it's alive!

## What you can do to help
Everything. No joke. I have no experience in Lua, so I'm sure there's a lot that can be optimized and improved. If you want to check it out (and probably cringe a little) feel free to check the code, and use it for whatever you need. It's  all yours, my friend.
